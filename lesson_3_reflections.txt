When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever I want share my work public I can use remote repository. This will help others 
to see and contribute to my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes the changes are made not by me but some other people if I don't want to reflect
that changes automatically then there should be a manual mechanism to do that.
